## What is RFM?
Customers are the company's main asset. To sustain business success, companies need to attract customers' attention and retain them. Therefore, companies need to understand the characteristics and needs of customers. The approach that can be taken is to segment customers with the RFM method. 

Recency, frequency, monetary valueÂ (RFM) is a marketing analysis tool used to identify a firm's best clients based on the nature of their spending habits [1].

There are 3 attributes used in the RFM segmentation in this study, they are:
1. Recency: How recently has the customer shopped in the store? 
It is numeric values obtained from subtracting the customer's last time purchases date with the customer's first purchases date.


2. Frequency: How frequently does the customer shop at the store? It is numeric values obtained from subtracting the customer's final transaction date with the analysis date determined by the researcher.

3. Monetary: How much money has a customer spent in that store during the time of analysis? it is obtained from the accumulation of multiplication between the quantity attribute and the unit price. But in this case, we use the "Sales" field instead because the unit price attribute is not available.

The data for this analysis is available [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BJQtz_Xw8FwfiPL5Dg0gjUF8xvmafNJO/view?usp=drivesdk)

## Customer Segmentation Result
The number of customer segments can be done according to the requirements. In this case, we choose to divide the customer into 6 segments as shown in the barplot below.

After the customer segmentation is formed, the next step is to determine the needed actions treat customers in each segments.
1. Loyalist: These customers love to buy our brand. Reward them so that they will promote our brand.

2. Potential Loyalists: Keep them engaged by coming up with attractive offers and festive discounts.

3. Promising: They have had a good purchase history but not great lately. Ask for feedback, offer personalized recommendations.

4. Hesitant: These customers are passive. Assess feedback from the customers through online/physical surveys. Try to understand their expectations and exceed them every time.

5. Need attention: If no suitable action is taken, these customers have a risk of becoming detractors. Strengthen their interest by offering them tailor-made offers/discounts to make them excited about our brand.

6. Detractors: There is a chance that these customers have been disappointed with the product or brand in the past and no longer want to come back. Detractors have a high probability of giving bad reviews and bad-mouthing the product. Strategize the actions to follow up with the detractors. Address any concerns, make improvements, and offer rectification, if possible [2].
